# CS255_System_Design

In this course, I learned about various methods of conveying a system's logic and data flow through the use of a variety of diagrams.
The mock system being built is called DriverPass. The class began with reading over an interview with the "owner" of the project and the
development team. From this, a plan is constructed to outline the key features of the system, and what it would take to accomplish the
main objectives of the system. DriverPass is a web app that would help students pass their DMV exam. It requires users to login/register their
account, and to perform their necessary functions according to the type of user they are (student, admin, driver, etc). The system was then
outlined to be built a certain way with a variety of objects, actors, classes, authentication, database, etc to be developed.
